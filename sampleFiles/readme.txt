This directory contains sample files with which to 
test and experiment with the Utah SAXS Tools.
These files were used to generate the examples in the documenation.

The files are organized in the following directories:

saxsess_images: Contains two tif files with data recorded on a
SAXSess instrument with an image plate detctor.  One file contains
data from a sample of native ribonuclease A (RNAse A)
and the other is the buffer control for that experiment. 
These files can be opened in ImageJ and processed to generate PDH files 
with beam profiles.

inputFiles: Contains several PDH files used in the examples
in the documentaion.  These are PDH files with data for RNAse A
and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (bpti).
This directory also contains parameter files for the 
saxsDeSmear, saxsFit and saxsSmear programs
and a model file for different oligomeric forms of BPTI,
as illustrated in the documentation.

ResultsFiles: Contains files generated by processing the input files
with the various USToo programs.

shellScripts: Contains the example scripts shown in the documentation.  
Descriptions of these scripts are provided in the documentation and
in comment lines in the files.
